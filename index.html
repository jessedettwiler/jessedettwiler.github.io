      <h2>What is Folk-Hop?</h2>
      <p>
        Folk-Hop is a gentle meeting between two worlds: the folk culture of artists like Bob Dylan,
        and the lo-fi hip-hop legacy of J. Dilla.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s a warm, human form of instrumental music — built with acoustic guitars, ukuleles, flutes,
        banjos, harmonicas, kalimbas, mandolins, and quiet “la-la-la” voices that feel close and real.
        The drums come from hip-hop, but remain organic: handmade percussions, real kits, imperfect textures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Folk-Hop is what Bob Dylan or Bon Iver might sound like if they lived inside chill beats.
        Music that breathes. Music that feels like a walk outside.

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        C4C is the artistic identity of Jesse Aymon Dettwiler. The name first appeared in 2017, during
        his earliest Folk-Hop experiments — it simply felt right, and never left.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally, C4C stood for “Creations For Christ” — a quiet reminder that music, for him,
        has always been tied to something greater than himself. Faith has remained a subtle but
        steady root in his creative journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based in French-speaking Switzerland, between lakes and mountains, Jesse grew up in France
        with an Australian mother and a Swiss father. At eighteen, military service brought him to
        Switzerland — and it became home.
      </p>
      <p>
        He draws inspiration from calm landscapes, silence, and slowness. He loves music that rests
        the mind rather than agitates it. Music that speaks without words.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through his work, he hopes listeners feel safe — as if stepping outside mentally, breathing
        fresh air, letting stress fall away. A pause in a noisy world. An invitation to slow down,
        to rest, to reconnect.
